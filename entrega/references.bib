	abstract = {Abstract
            An extensive treatment is provided of methods that use log‐linear approximations to solve nonlinear dynamic discrete‐time stochastic models. These methods, based on their linear counterparts, have been extensively used in the macroeconomic literature, and Uhlig simplifies, integrates, and compares them. He shows how to log‐linearize the necessary equations characterizing the equilibrium without explicit differentiation, provides a general solution to a linearized system using the method of undetermined coefficients, allowing in particular for a vector of endogenous states, and provides a simulation‐free frequency‐domain method to calculate the model implications in its Hodrick–Prescott filtered version. These methods are easy to use if a numerical package such as {MATLAB} is available. Examples of the approach taken are presented in an appendix, which looks at Hansen's (1985) real business cycle model for the case of saddle‐point stability (using the Blanchard–Kahn approach) and the case where equilibria may be undetermined; the appendix also describes the {MATLAB} programs needed to carry out the calculations.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This paper develops a New Keynesian model featuring financial intermediation, short- and long-term bonds, credit shocks, and scope for unconventional monetary policy. The log-linearized model reduces to four equations: Phillips and {IS} curves, as well as policy rules for the short-term interest rate and the central bank's long-bond portfolio ({QE}). Credit shocks and {QE} appear in both the {IS} and Phillips curves. In equilibrium, optimal monetary policy entails adjusting the short-term interest rate to offset natural rate shocks but using {QE} to offset credit market disruptions. Use of {QE} significantly mitigates the costs of a binding zero lower bound.},
